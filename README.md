# Day 5 of 100days with code

I studied Api and how to implement them

### What is Api
The term API is an acronym, and it stands for “Application Programming Interface.”

Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to.

Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As” dialog box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.

## What Project did I work on today
I created a weather app where the user can input location and get the weather info of the area.

### What did I learn today

- Categories of api
